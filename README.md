# Pacghost 🎮

Pacghost is a fun little **terminal-based game** I hacked together pretty quickly.
It started as a draft experiment, but I decided to clean it up and put it here — because why not?

You play as `👻` and must roam the maze to collect all the hypnotic coins `◉` while avoiding the ghosts `👾`.
Drop bombs to freeze enemies, survive, and see how fast you can win!

## ✨ Features

* Terminal-based Pac-Man–style gameplay
* Smooth player movement (`👻`) with arrow keys
* Multiple enemies (`👾`) chasing you
* Hypnotic coins `◉` to collect
* Bomb mechanic 💣 (freeze enemies for 10s, but don’t get too close!)
* Replay option on death, win screen shows your completion time
* Clean, aesthetic maze with clear walls and boundaries
